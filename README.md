# ESP8266 Based IoT Kit

## Overview
This project demonstrates an IoT kit based on the ESP8266 module, designed for real-time data monitoring and control. The system integrates various sensors and actuators to provide a comprehensive IoT solution.

## Features
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Uses ESP8266 for Wi-Fi communication.
- **Sensor Integration**: Supports multiple sensors for data collection.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays sensor data on a web-based dashboard.
- **Remote Control**: Allows remote operation of connected devices.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for ease of access.

## Components Used
- **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)** - Main microcontroller for IoT connectivity.
- **Sensors**:
  - DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity)
  - MQ-135 (Gas Sensor)
  - LDR (Light Sensor)
- **Actuators**:
  - Relay Module (For controlling appliances)
  - LED Indicator
- **Other Components**:
  - OLED Display (Optional for local monitoring)
  - Power Supply (5V/3.3V as required)

## Installation & Setup
